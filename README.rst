Features
--------
* Represents Apache Cassandra partitions as JSON over HTTP
* Works with all supported Cassandra data types
* Simple configuration: keyspace, table list, credentials, hosts and ports
* Dynamic discoverability: tables, partition keys and data
* Built on Clojure 1.9, http-kit, Ring & Compojure

Dynamic Discoverability
-----------------------
Nemo resources create a traversable tree which allows clients
to discover tables, partition keys & partition data.
