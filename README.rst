Nemo
====
Read Apache Cassandra partitions over HTTP.

Features
--------
* Represents Apache Cassandra partitions as JSON over HTTP
* Works with all supported Cassandra data types
* Simple configuration: keyspace, table list, credentials, hosts and ports
* Traversable resource tree: tables to partition keys to partition data
* Built on Clojure 1.9, http-kit, Ring & Compojure

Traversable Resource Tree
-------------------------
Nemo resources create a traversable resource tree which allows clients
to dynamically discover tables & partition keys, which may then be used
to query Cassandra partitions.

Documentation (WIP)
-------------------
* Changelog
* Configuration
* Running
* HTTP requests & responses
* Testing & Developing
* CPU and Memory Profiling Results (WIP)
* Limitations (Does not accept maps, sets, lists or blobs as partition keys (is this even valid for Cassandra?)

Running
-------

From a jarfile:

.. code-block:: bash
                
   export HTTP_PORT=5757
   export DB_HOST=a.cassandra.host
   export DB_PORT=9042
   export DB_USER=cassandra_user
   export DB_PASS=cassandra_pw
   export DB_KEYSPACE=target_keyspace
   export DB_TABLES=table1,table2,table3
   
   java -jar lcmap-nemo:1.0

   
From Docker:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it --rm \
              -e HTTP_PORT=5757 \
              -e DB_HOST=a.cassandra.host \
              -e DB_PORT=9042 \
              -e DB_USER=cassandra_user \
              -e DB_PASS=cassandra_pw \
              -e DB_KEYSPACE=target_keyspace \
              -e DB_TABLES=table1,table2,table3 \
